National Sketch Writing Month (NaSkeWriMo) is a month-long challenge for comedy
writers to write thirty brand new sketches in thirty days during the month of
September. The website allows writers to track their progress and share links to
their sketches, if they wish to share them.

National Sketch Writing Month is a community project. If you would like to propose a change or submit a patch, don't be shy! If you're not a coder but would like to contribute in some other way, join our mailing list:
