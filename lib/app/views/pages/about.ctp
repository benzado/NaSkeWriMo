	This is the website for National Sketch Writing Month. We have unilaterally declared September to be the month when comedy writers attempt to write 30 sketches in 30 days, as a way to motivate ourselves and get into the habit of writing.

	National Sketch Writing Month, or NaSkeWriMo for short, came about because of a <a href="http://www.improvresourcecenter.com/mb/showthread.php?t=59573">message board discussion</a> about finding the motivation to write. We decided to borrow the idea behind National Novel Writing Month and declare September to be a month for writing 30 sketches in 30 days. This website was set up for keeping track of your sketch count, to foster community and create a forum in which to brag.
